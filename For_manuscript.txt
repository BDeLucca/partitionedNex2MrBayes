The datatype must be set to DNA only (and not "standard" (i.e., mixture of DNA and indels codes)).

My code does contain matrix checks (i.e., check if charset range continuous; check if no range is overlapping, etc.); it is unclear that PartitionFinder2 does that.

The MrBayes block of PartitionFinder2 cannot be pasted below a NEXUS block for large datasets > 99 990 bp, because MrBayes cannot handle those. Instead, the NEXUS block must be partitioned immediately.
