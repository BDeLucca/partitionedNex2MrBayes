If you use any of the datasets here, please make sure to reference three things:

    The original study,

    The dataset itself if the dataset has its own DOI (e.g. data dryad datasets have their own DOI's and should be referenced separately).

    This repository (github.com/roblanf/BenchmarkAlignments)

This is essential to reward and acknowledge those who spend weeks and months in the field, laboriously chasing frogs/flies/lizards etc., then are kind enough to share their data with the world so that people like me (and you, if you're reading this) can re-use them for other things.
